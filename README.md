# Compilers, Interpreters & Language Working



🔹 1. Compiler vs Interpreter :-

Compiler: Translates entire program into machine code (faster execution).

Ex: C, C++ (compiled → binary → run).


Interpreter: Executes code line-by-line (slower, flexible).

Ex: Python, JavaScript.



---

🔹 2. How Python Works :-

1. Python source code (.py) → Interpreter


2. Code is first compiled into bytecode (.pyc)


3. Bytecode is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)


4. Optional: JIT (Just-In-Time) compilers like PyPy speed up execution.



---

🔹 3. How Other Languages Work :-

C / C++

Source code → Compiler → Machine code (direct execution).


Java

Source code → Compiler → Bytecode (.class) → JVM (interprets / JIT compiles).


JavaScript

Code → JS Engine (e.g., V8) → Parser + Interpreter + JIT → Machine code.


Go / Rust

Source code → Compiler → Binary → Run (like C).



---

🔹 4. Six Phases of Compilation (Universal) :- 

1. Lexical Analysis (Scanner) :-

Breaks code into tokens.

Ex: int x = 5; → int, x, =, 5, ;



2. Syntax Analysis (Parser) :-

Checks grammar via parse tree/AST.

Ex: Verifies assignment statement.



3. Semantic Analysis :-

Checks meaning (type checking, scope rules).

Ex: Can’t add string to int.



4. Intermediate Code Generation (IR) :-

Converts AST → Intermediate Representation (portable).



5. Optimization :-

Improves IR (remove redundancies, loop optimizations).



6. Code Generation :-

IR → Target Machine Code (assembly/binary).




(Additional Phase: Symbol Table Management + Error Handling throughout)


---

🔹 5. Mapping Phases in Languages :-

C / C++ → All 6 phases → Machine Code.

Java → All 6 phases → Bytecode → JVM interprets/JIT compiles.

Python → Mini-compiler (phases 1–4) → Bytecode → PVM interprets.

JavaScript → Parser + Interpreter + JIT → Optimized machine code.



---

🔹 6. Key Takeaways :-

Compiled langs = Faster, optimized binaries.

Interpreted langs = Flexible, slower, but portable.

Modern trend: Hybrid (Bytecode + VM + JIT) → Best of both worlds.

# From High-Level Language to Executable + Platform Dependence



🔹 1. Journey of Code (HLL → Executable)

1. High-Level Language (HLL)

Human-readable code (Python, C, Java).



2. Preprocessing (C/C++ only)

Handles macros, header files, directives (#include, #define).



3. Compilation

HLL → Assembly/Intermediate Code

Syntax + semantic checks done here.



4. Assembly

Converts to machine instructions (object code).



5. Linking

Combines multiple object files + libraries into a single executable.



6. Loading & Execution

OS loads executable into memory and CPU runs it.





---

🔹 2. Execution Flow in Different Languages

C/C++
HLL → Compiler → Object Code → Linker → Executable (Platform Dependent)

Java
HLL (.java) → Compiler → Bytecode (.class) → JVM → Machine Code (Platform Independent via JVM)

Python
HLL (.py) → Interpreter → Bytecode (.pyc) → Python Virtual Machine (PVM) → Execution

.NET Languages (C#, VB.NET)
HLL → Compiler → CIL (Common Intermediate Language) → CLR (Common Language Runtime) → Execution



---

🔹 3. Platform Dependent vs Platform Independent

📍 Platform Dependent

Code runs only on the system/architecture it was compiled for.

Ex: C/C++ → compiled into machine code specific to Windows/Linux/Mac.

Requires recompilation for each OS.


📍 Platform Independent

Code runs on any platform with a supporting VM/runtime.

Ex: Java (JVM), Python (PVM), .NET (CLR).

HLL → Intermediate Code → Executed on VM (portable).



---

🔹 4. Key Idea

Native compilation → fast, but platform dependent.

VM/Bytecode → portable, but slightly slower.

Modern JIT compilers (Java HotSpot, PyPy, V8 for JS) bridge the gap: portability + speed.



---

⚡ Quick Mnemonic:
👉 “Write Once, Run Anywhere” = Platform Independent (Java, Python).
👉 “Write Once, Compile Everywhere” = Platform Dependent (C/C++).
